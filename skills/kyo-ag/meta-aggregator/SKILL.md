# KYO.ag Meta Aggregator Skill

> Compare quotes from multiple DEX aggregators and execute the best swap through a competition model.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a competition
curl -X POST https://api.kyo.ag/competitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chainId": 1,
    "tokenIn": "0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",
    "tokenOut": "0xB8f28C60dD8240141185a192fa4156A23E189305",
    "amountIn": "1000000000000000000",
    "userAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "slippage": 0.01
  }'

# Response includes: { "competitionId": "abc123", "availableAggregators": ["..."], ... }

# 2. Fetch quote from each aggregator
curl -X POST "https://api.kyo.ag/quotes?aggregator=<from_availableAggregators>&competitionId=abc123"
# POST request with no body

# 3. Get all results ranked
curl https://api.kyo.ag/competitions/abc123/results

# 4. Execute swap with the best aggregator
curl -X POST "https://api.kyo.ag/swap?aggregator=<from_availableAggregators>&competitionId=abc123"
# POST request with no body
```

## How It Works

```
Create competition → Fetch quotes per aggregator → Compare results → Execute best swap
```

1. **Create Competition** — Submit swap parameters. Returns `competitionId` and list of `availableAggregators`.
2. **Fetch Quotes** — Query each aggregator individually using the `competitionId`. Run in parallel for speed.
3. **Compare Results** — Call the results endpoint to see all quotes ranked side by side.
4. **Execute Swap** — Call `/swap` with the winning aggregator to get transaction calldata.

## Base URL

```
https://api.kyo.ag
```

Meta Aggregator endpoints do not include `chainId` in the path.
Provide `chainId` in the `POST /competitions` request body.

## Authentication

Authorization is optional:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Calls without an API key are supported.
With an API key, partners can receive higher RPS limits (up to 10x) and revshare.

## Rate Limits

- Without API key (Meta Aggregator API): 20 requests/minute
- With API key: up to 10x higher
- Limits are subject to change; abusive traffic or persistently low swap-to-quote ratios may be throttled

Request an API key via [this form](https://forms.gle/usDeWvH21Z85UccZ6).

## Endpoints

### POST /competitions

Create a new competition.

**Request Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| chainId | integer | Yes | Chain ID (e.g. 999 for HyperEVM) |
| tokenIn | string | Yes | Input token address |
| tokenOut | string | Yes | Output token address |
| amountIn | string | Yes | Input amount in wei |
| userAddress | string | Yes | User wallet address |
| slippage | number | Yes | Slippage tolerance (0.01 = 1%) |
| tokenInDecimals | integer | No | Decimals of tokenIn (default: 18) |

**Response:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| competitionId | string | Unique competition identifier |
| availableAggregators | string[] | List of aggregator names to query |
| chainId | integer | Chain ID |
| expiresAt | string | ISO 8601 expiration timestamp |

### POST /quotes?aggregator={agg}&competitionId={id}

Fetch a pricing quote from a specific aggregator.
This is a `POST` endpoint with no request body.

**Response:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| aggregator | string | Aggregator name |
| tokenIn | string | Input token address |
| tokenOut | string | Output token address |
| amountIn | string | Input amount in wei |
| amountOut | string | Output amount in wei |
| gasEstimate | string? | Estimated gas cost |
| competitionId | string | Competition ID |

### GET /competitions/{id}/results

Get all quotes for a competition, ranked by output amount.

**Response:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| competitionId | string | Competition ID |
| chainId | integer | Chain ID |
| tokenIn | string | Input token address |
| tokenOut | string | Output token address |
| amountIn | string | Input amount in wei |
| quotes | array | Array of quotes sorted by amountOut |

### POST /swap?aggregator={agg}&competitionId={id}

Get transaction calldata for the chosen aggregator.
This is a `POST` endpoint with no request body.

**Response:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| aggregator | string | Aggregator name |
| tokenIn | string | Input token address |
| tokenOut | string | Output token address |
| amountIn | string | Input amount in wei |
| amountOut | string | Output amount in wei |
| to | string | Contract to send the tx to |
| data | string | Calldata for the swap tx |
| value | string | Native value to send (for native token sells) |
| allowanceTarget | string | Contract that needs token approval |
| competitionId | string | Competition ID |

Unlike `/v1/swap`, this endpoint returns `to`, `data`, and `value` directly (not a `transactions[]` array).

## Agent Integration Pattern

```python
import requests

API_KEY = ""  # optional
BASE = "https://api.kyo.ag"
AUTH_HEADERS = {} if not API_KEY else {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
JSON_HEADERS = {"Content-Type": "application/json", **AUTH_HEADERS}

# Step 1: Create competition
comp = requests.post(f"{BASE}/competitions", headers=JSON_HEADERS, json={
    "chainId": 1,
    "tokenIn": "0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",
    "tokenOut": "0xB8f28C60dD8240141185a192fa4156A23E189305",
    "amountIn": "1000000000000000000",
    "userAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "slippage": 0.01
}).json()

competition_id = comp["competitionId"]
aggregators = comp["availableAggregators"]

# Step 2: Fetch quotes in parallel
import concurrent.futures

def fetch_quote(agg):
    resp = requests.post(
        f"{BASE}/quotes?aggregator={agg}&competitionId={competition_id}",
        headers=AUTH_HEADERS
    )
    if resp.status_code == 200:
        return resp.json()
    return None  # aggregator may not support this pair

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:
    quotes = [q for q in pool.map(fetch_quote, aggregators) if q]

if not quotes:
    raise Exception("No aggregator returned a valid quote")

# Step 3: Pick the best quote
best = max(quotes, key=lambda q: int(q["amountOut"]))
print(f"Best: {best['aggregator']} → {best['amountOut']}")

# Step 4: Get swap calldata
swap = requests.post(
    f"{BASE}/swap?aggregator={best['aggregator']}&competitionId={competition_id}",
    headers=AUTH_HEADERS
).json()

# Step 5: Execute transaction
# send_transaction(swap["to"], swap["data"], swap["value"])
```

## Error Handling

| HTTP Status | Error | Description | Solution |
|-------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 400 | Bad request | Invalid parameters | Check required fields and types |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Invalid API key in Authorization header (when provided) | Verify Bearer token or omit the header |
| 404 | Not found | Competition ID does not exist | Create a new competition |
| 410 | Gone | Competition has expired | Create a new competition and retry |

Individual aggregator quotes may fail silently (e.g., aggregator doesn't support the token pair). Always filter out failed responses before comparing.

## Tips for Agents

1. **Competitions expire quickly** — fetch quotes and execute the swap promptly after creation
2. **Fetch quotes in parallel** — use `Promise.all` / `concurrent.futures` for speed
3. **Filter failed quotes** — some aggregators may return errors; skip them when picking the best
4. **Use `allowanceTarget` for approvals** — this may differ from the `to` address
5. **For native token input** — send `value` with the transaction, no ERC20 approval needed
6. **Check `expiresAt`** — if close to expiry, create a fresh competition instead of retrying
7. **No request body for /quotes and /swap** — these endpoints only take query parameters
